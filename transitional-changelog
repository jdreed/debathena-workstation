debathena-workstation (0.7) unstable; urgency=high

  * After April 30 2009, we will be changing debathena-workstation to be
    largely identical to the Debathena cluster configuration, except for
    some cluster-specific user isolation measures.
  
    If you do not want these additional customizations, you should remove
    this package and install debathena-login-graphical.
